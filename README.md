- ⚡ Fun fact: Python was not named after a snake.
- Python is a widely-used, object-oriented, and high-level programming language with dynamic semantics, used for general-purpose programming.
- It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released on February 20, 1991.
- While we may all know Python as a giant snake, the name of the Python programming language actually comes from an old BBC comedy sketch series called Monty Python’s Flying Circus.
